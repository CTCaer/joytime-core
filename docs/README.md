Welcome to The Docs, your one stop shop on how to use Joytime!

Each section of the docs comes in 2 flavors: C, and C++.

If you're new to Joytime and looking to make something super cool with it (as most
that come by here are), you'll probably want to check out the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/README.md) for a quick tutorial on how to get setup.

If you're already (somewhat) familiar with Joytime and just want to checkout the
API, here you go: [take me to the API](api/README.md)!

Otherwise, if you're looking to develop an input library for Joytime, let's [go see the IPI](input-libraries/README.md)
(that's the Input Programming Interface).
